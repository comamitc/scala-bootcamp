# prog2 - Fibonacci function

By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

`Fn = F{n-1} + F{n-2}`

# hints

- Let's only accept `Int` for simplicity
- Grasp of syntax is more valueable that performance optimisation
- The scala compiler tries to detect tail recursion and _automagically_ optimizes on compilation.
